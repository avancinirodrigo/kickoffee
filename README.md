# Kickooffee
Kickoff a OO python REST application while having a coffee

# Main Use Case 
## UC0001 - Provide a Simple REST API Foundation

**Primary Actor:** Developer

**Stakeholders and Interests:**
* Me: Desires to provide a well crafted REST API foundation for quick kick-off of either a study, challenge, real application or anything.
* Developer: May use this project as the foundation of her/his app.
* Contributor: May help Me to craft this project and give some advice and ideas for a successful move forward with this project.

**Preconditions:** Developer has a study, challenge or a real REST application to be done.

**Success Guarantee (or Postconditions):** I received feedback about this project from Devs and Contributors. Hopefully, some Dev found this project useful for her/himself. 

**Happy Path**

1. Developer finds Kickooffee project.
1. Developer gets Kickooffee project.
1. Kickooffee provides a foundation with the minimum necessary to create a REST API application.
1. Developer customizes Kickooffee according to her/his needs.
1. Developer keeps going with her/his project.
1. Developer gives the Kickooffee credits.


**Extensions (or Alternative Flows):**

4a. Kickoofee provides more than Developer needs:
1. Developer removes what her/him don't want.

4b. Kickoofee provides less than Developer needs:
1. Developer open an issue on Kickoofee repo.
1. I will analyze what could be done.
1. I will give a feedback about it.
1. I will solve the issue.
1. Developer gets again Kickooffee project updated.

**Special Requirements:**

* Database ORM and raw SQL framework
* REST APIs frameworks
* Foundation includes User CRUD, SignUP, LogIn, Auth
